# Linear_Regression_Model

-> Data Pre-processing to remove outliers & null values in the data, imputing the data and to convert categorical variables into numberical variables(dummies).

-> Understanding the concepts of Mean Regression with respect to Numerical and Categorical features, then coming to conclusion why mean regression is not an optimal model with the help of residual plots.

-> Understanding the Gradient Descent and implementing it manually in two dimensions(only one independent variable) at very low learning rate.

-> Scaling the values with the help StandardScaler from sklearn library. Treating Multi-Collinearity by removing features with Variance Inflation Factor > 5.

->The test and train sets are created for both independent and dependent varialbles and implementing Linear Regression model from Sklearn library on training data.

->Residuals were plotted to check the presence of Homoscedasticity.

->At the end, the model was tested with test data and the model acheives a r^2 score of 84.72%.
